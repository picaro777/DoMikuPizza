        message.channel.send(`You will need: -Duct tape -Alcohol -Matches -A broom handle -Ziploc gallon-sized bags -15.24cm pipe with a radius of 5.08cm -Threaded caps for each end -A candle -A drill -Liquid nail glue -Cotton balls -Ruler -Sharpie -A fuse -blackpowder (Iâ€™ll make a post later for the blackpowder recipe)

        Mark every 2.54cm on the pipe and drill a hole in the end cap for the detonator. Then insert the fuse and secure it with the candle wax. Clean it with the alcohol and screw on the first end cap. 
        
        Next put all of the matches into the pipe and stuff them down with the broomstick handle. Place the cotton balls on top of that with the fuse sticking out. Then cut a hole in the bag and insert the bag into the pipe with the fuse in the hole.
        
        Make sure the bag overlaps the open end of the pipe and fill it with the black powder before closing the bag and shoving it in the pipe.
        
        Fill any remaining space with the cotton and screw the second end cap on after cleaning it with the alcohol. Use the nail glue and tape to secure it.`)
